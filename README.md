This is a repository for HCL mini project 
This project introduces a web-based local chess multiplayer game, developed 
exclusively with frontend technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It seeks to 
address the need for genuine social engagement, offering an opportunity for two 
players to sit side by side and immerse themselves in a world of fun, challenge, and 
enjoyment. This introduction sets the stage for a project that not only celebrates the 
simplicity and accessibility of frontend technologies but also highlights the enduring 
appeal of local multiplayer gaming experiences in an era defined by online connectivity.
The primary objective of this project is to craft a web-based local multiplayer chess 
game, delivering an engaging and easily accessible gaming experience for two players 
sharing a single computer. At its core, the project strives to rejuvenate the in-person 
social interactions and shared entertainment in a digital age marked by online isolation. 
Key goals encompass providing accessible gaming on various devices without 
complicated installations, creating a user-friendly interface that caters to players of all 
backgrounds, fostering captivating gameplay through innovative mechanics and 
challenges, and ensuring adaptability to different screen sizes via responsive design. 
The project seeks to evoke nostalgia for traditional local multiplayer gaming while 
infusing it with creativity and fun, all while operating independently without reliance on 
backend servers or online connectivity. Usability testing and user feedback will refine 
the user experience, and comprehensive documentation will guide players through the 
game's mechanics. Ultimately, the project aspires to exemplify how frontend 
technologies can harmonize accessibility and entertainment, bringing people together 
through an enjoyable and socially engaging gaming experience.
The scope of this project is extensive and revolves around the development of a webbased local multiplayer chess game, exclusively utilizing frontend technologies (HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript). Key components encompass the creation of an engaging and 
accessible user interface (UI) with responsive design principles for seamless crossdevice compatibility. The project will integrate intricate game mechanics, including 
player interaction, competition, and gameplay scenarios, with a strong focus on 
10
usability and player experience. This scope covers the design and implementation of 
graphics, animations, and interactive elements to enhance the gaming environment. It 
entails rigorous testing for bug identification and performance optimization, ensuring a 
smooth user experience. User feedback will be actively solicited and integrated into 
iterative development phases, and comprehensive documentation will guide players 
through the game. The project will culminate in the deployment of the game on a local 
server with ongoing user support and maintenance, guaranteeing a polished and 
engaging local multiplayer gaming experience, while setting the stage for potential 
future enhancements and iterations.
